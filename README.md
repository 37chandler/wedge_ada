About the Wedge <br> <br>

The Wedge Co-Op is the largest co-operative grocery store in the US and is in Minneapolis, MN. Through a partnership with the co-op, we have data dating back to January 1, 2010 from the point-of-sale (POS) system that the Wedge developed . We have data through January 2017. This system logs every row of every receipt. While we do not have other sources of data such as ordering, inventory, and spoilage, this transaction-level view is one of the richest data sets available to us. The source of this richness is that the Wedge is a member-owned co-operative. The public is welcome to shop there, but membership is lightweight: $80 (which can be paid in installments) buys you shares which entitle you to $3.75 off per month, other Member discounts, and annual refunds based on business profitability. <br> <br>
